# FacebookFilter
A Basic Chrome Extension to Filter Your Facebook Feed

# Description:
This project is simply a learning experience. The extension is an attempt to filter your Facebook Feed without having to unfollow a friend or favorited page. Currently, `content.js` must be manually editted in order to filter key words. The end goal is to have users be able to enter a key word that they wish to have filtered from their feed from the popup menu invoked by the extension button.

# How to use:
  1. Download and unzip the package.  
  2. Go to `chrome://extensions/` and enable `Developer mode`.  
  3. Click on `Load unpacked extension...`.
  4. Find the unzip file.
  5. Click `Ok`.
  6. Navigate to Facebook and watch as post with the words `sermon` and `visiting` disappear (current example).
